Newton’s laws of mechanics are invariantin all reference systems connected by a Galilean transformation.\\nSpeed of Light\\nIn about 1860 James Clerk Maxwell summarized the experimental observations ofelectricity and magnetism in a consistent set of four concise equations. UnlikeNewton’s laws of motion, Maxwell’s equations are not invariant under a Galileantransformation between inertial reference frames (Figure 1-4). Since the Maxwellequations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves whose speed would be a par-ticular value, , the excellent agreement between thisnumber and the measured value of the speed of light\\n3and between the predicted po-\\nlarization properties of electromagnetic waves and those observed for light providedstrong confirmation of the assumption that light was an electromagnetic wave and,therefore, traveled at speed c.\\n4\\nThat being the case, it was postulated in the nineteenth century that electromagnetic\\nwaves, like all other waves, propagated in a suitable material medium. The implicationof this postulate was that the medium, called the ether, filled the entire universe,\\nincluding the interior of matter. (The Greek philosopher Aristotle had first suggested thatthe universe was permeated with “ether” 2000 years earlier.) In this way the remarkableopportunity arose to establish experimentally the existence of the all-pervasive ether bymeasuring the speed of light relative to Earth as Earth moved relative to the ether atspeed v, as would be predicted by Equation 1-3. The value of cwas given by the\\nMaxwell equations, and the speed of Earth relative to the ether, while not known, wasassumed to be at least equal to its orbital speed around the Sun, about 30 km s.

What would the relative velocity of the inertial systems in Figure 1-4 need to be\\nin order for the S/H11032 observer to measure no net electromagnetic force on the\\ncharge q?\\n2. Discuss why the very large value for the speed of the electromagnetic waves\\nwould imply that the ether be rigid, i.e., have a large bulk modulus.\\nThe Michelson-Morley Experiment\\nAll waves that were known to nineteenth-century scientists required a medium inorder to propagate. Surface waves moving across the ocean obviously require thewater. Similarly, waves move along a plucked guitar string, across the surface of astruck drumhead, through Earth after an earthquake, and, indeed, in all materials actedupon by suitable forces. The speed of the waves depends on the properties of themedium and is derived relative to the medium. For example, the speed of sound waves\\nin air, i.e., their absolute motion relative to still air, can be measured. The Doppler ef-fect for sound in air depends not only on the relative motion of the source and listener,but also on the motion of each relative to still air. Thus, it was natural for scientists ofthat time to expect the existence of some material like the ether to support the propa-gation of light and other electromagnetic waves and to expect that the absolute mo-\\ntion of Earth through the ether should be detectable, despite the fact that the ether hadnot been observed previously.\\nMichelson realized that although the effect of Earth’s motion on the results of any\\n“out-and–back” speed of light measurement, such as shown generically in Figure 1-5,would be too small to measure directly, it should be possible to measure v\\n2c2by a dif-\\nference measurement, using the interference property of the light waves as a sensitive“clock.” The apparatus that he designed to make the measurement is called theMichelson interferometer. The purpose of the Michelson-Morley experiment was tomeasure the speed of light relative to the interferometer (i.e., relative to Earth), therebydetecting Earth’s motion through the ether and thus verifying the latter’s existence. Toillustrate how the interferometer works and the reasoning behind the experiment, let usfirst describe an analogous situation set in more familiar surroundings.>', metadata={'source': 'Tipler_Llewellyn.pdf', 'page': 24}), Document(page_content='8 Chapter 1 Relativity I\\nEXAMPLE 1-1 A Boat Race Two equally matched rowers race each other over\\ncourses as shown in Figure 1-6 a.

The beams travel along the mutually\\nperpendicular paths 1 and 2, reflect from mirrors M1andM2, and return to A , where they\\nrecombine and are viewed by the observer. The compensator’s purpose is to make the twopaths of equal optical length, so that the lengths Lcontain the same number of light waves,\\nby making both beams pass through two thicknesses of glass before recombining.

Thus, the observer O sees M1\\nand the image of M2formed by the partially reflecting second surface of the beam\\nsplitter, forming a thin wedge-shaped film of air between them. The interference of the tworecombining beams depends on the number of waves in each path, which in turn depends on(1) the length of each path and (2) the speed of light (relative to the instrument) in eachpath. Regardless of the value of that speed, the wedge-shaped air film between M\\n1and\\nresults in an increasing path length for beam 2 relative to beam 1, looking from left to rightacross the observer’s field of view; hence, the observer sees a series of parallel interferencefringes as in (b ), alternately yellow and black from constructive and destructive\\ninterference, respectively.M\\nœ\\n2Mœ\\n2,\\nEquation 1-6.

Instead, the shift observed was only\\nabout 0.01 fringe, i.e., approximately the experimental uncertainty of the apparatus.With characteristic reserve, Michelson described the results thus:\\n6\\nThe actual displacement [of the fringes] was certainly less than the twentieth part\\n[of 0.4 fringe], and probably less than the fortieth part. But since the displace-ment is proportional to the square of the velocity, the relative velocity of the earthand the ether is probably less than one-sixth the earth’s orbital velocity and cer-tainly less than one-fourth.\\nMichelson and Morley had placed an upper limit on Earth’s motion relative to the\\nether of about 5 km s. From this distance in time it is difficult for us to appreciatethe devastating impact of this result. The then-accepted theory of light propagationcould not be correct, and the ether as a favored frame of reference for Maxwell’s equa-tions was not tenable. The experiment was repeated by a number of people more thana dozen times under various conditions and with improved precision, and no shift hasever been found. In the most precise attempt, the upper limit on the relative velocitywas lowered to 1.5 km s by Georg Joos in 1930 using an interferometer with lightpaths much longer than Michelson’s. Recent, high-precision variations of the experi-ment using laser beams have lowered the upper limit to 15 m s.\\nMore generally, on the basis of this and other experiments, we must conclude that\\nMaxwell’s equations are correct and that the speed of electromagnetic radiation is thesame in all inertial reference systems independent of the motion of the source relativeto the observer. This invariance of the speed of light between inertial reference framesmeans that there must be some relativity principle that applies to electromagnetism aswell as to mechanics. That principle cannot be Newtonian relativity, which implies thedependence of the speed of light on the relative motion of the source and observer.It follows that the Galilean transformation of coordinates between inertial framescannot be correct but must be replaced with a new coordinate transformation whoseapplication preserves the invariance of the laws of electromagnetism. We then expectthat the fundamental laws of mechanics, which were consistent with the old Galileantransformation, will require modification in order to be invariant under the new trans-formation. The theoretical derivation of that new transformation was a cornerstone ofEinstein’s development of special relativity.\\nMore\\nA more complete description of the Michelson-Morley experiment, its\\ninterpretation, and the results of very recent versions can be found onthe home page: www.whfreeman.com/tiplermodernphysics5e.

We can then consider the Michelson apparatus and Earth to be at\\nrest. No fringe shift is expected when the interferometer is rotated 90°, since all di-rections are equivalent. The null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment is there-fore to be expected. It should be pointed out that Einstein did not set out to explainthe Michelson-Morley experiment. His theory arose from his considerations of thetheory of electricity and magnetism and the unusual property of electromagneticwaves that they propagate in a vacuum. In his first paper, which contains the completetheory of special relativity, he made only a passing reference to the experimental at-tempts to detect Earth’s motion through the ether, and in later years he could not re-call whether he was aware of the details of the Michelson-Morley experiment beforehe published his theory.\\nThe theory of special relativity was derived from two postulates proposed by\\nEinstein in his 1905 paper:\\nPostulate 1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.\\nPostulate 2. The speed of light in a vacuum is equal to the value c, independent\\nof the motion of the source.\\nPostulate 1 is an extension of the Newtonian principle of relativity to include all\\ntypes of physical measurements (not just measurements in mechanics). It implies that\\nno inertial system is preferred over any other; hence, absolute motion cannot be de-tected. Postulate 2 describes a common property of all waves. For example, the speedof sound waves does not depend on the motion of the sound source. When an ap-proaching car sounds its horn, the frequency heard increases according to the Dopplereffect, but the speed of the waves traveling through the air does not depend on thespeed of the car. The speed of the waves depends only on the properties of the air, suchas its temperature. The force of this postulate was to include light waves, for whichexperiments had found no propagation medium, together with all other waves, whosespeed wasknown to be independent of the speed of the source. Recent analysis of the\\nlight curves of gamma-ray bursts that occur near the edge of the observable universehave shown the speed of light to be independent of the speed of the source to a preci-sion of one part in 10\\n20.\\nAlthough each postulate seems quite reasonable, many of the implications of the\\ntwo together are surprising and seem to contradict common sense. One important im-plication of these postulates is that every observer measures the same value for thespeed of light independent of the relative motion of the source and observer. Considera light source S and two observers R\\n1, at rest relative to S, and R2, moving toward S\\nwith speed v, as shown in Figure 1-12 a. The speed of light measured by R1isc/H11005\\n3/H11003108m s. What is the speed measured by R2? The answer is not c /H11001 v, as one\\nwould expect based on Newtonian relativity. By postulate 1, Figure 1-12 ais equiva-\\nlent to Figure 1-12b, in which R2is at rest and the source SandR1are moving with\\nspeed v. That is, since absolute motion cannot be detected, it is not possible to say\\nwhich is really moving and which is at rest. By postulate 2, the speed of light from amoving source is independent of the motion of the source. Thus, looking at Figure1-12b, we see that R\\n2measures the speed of light to be c, just as R1does.

First, there is the concept of an event. A physical\\nevent is something that happens, like the closing of a door, a lightning strike, the col-lision of two particles, your birth, or the explosion of a star. Every event occurs atsome point in space and at some instant in time, but it is very important to recognizethat events are independent of the particular inertial reference frame that we might useto describe them. Events do not “belong” to any reference frame.\\nEvents are described by observers who do belong to particular inertial frames of\\nreference. Observers could be people (as in Section 1-1), electronic instruments, orother suitable recorders, but for our discussions in special relativity we are going to bevery specific. Strictly speaking, the observer will be an array of recording clocks lo-cated throughout the inertial reference system. It may be helpful for you to think ofthe observer as a person who goes around reading out the memories of the recordingclocks or receives records that have been transmitted from distant clocks, but alwayskeep in mind that in reporting events, such a person is strictly limited to summarizingthe data collected from the clock memories. The travel time of light precludes himfrom including in his report distant events that he may have seen by eye! It is in thissense that we will be using the word observer in our discussions.\\nEach inertial reference frame may be thought of as being formed by a cubic three-\\ndimensional lattice made of identical measuring rods (e.g., meter sticks) with arecording clock at each intersection as illustrated in Figure 1-13. The clocks are allidentical, and we, of course, want them all to read the “same time” as one another atany instant; i.e., they must be synchronized. There are many ways to accomplish syn-\\nchronization of the clocks, but a very straightforward way, made possible by the sec-ond postulate, is to use one of the clocks in the lattice as a standard, or reference clock.\\nFor convenience we will also use the location of the reference clock in the lattice asthe coordinate origin for the reference frame. The reference clock is started with itsindicator (hands, pointer, digital display) set at zero. At the instant it starts, it alsosends out a flash of light that spreads out as a spherical wave in all directions. Whenthe flash from the reference clock reaches the lattice clocks 1 meter away (notice thatin Figure 1-13 there are six of them, two of which are off the edges of the figure), we wanttheir indicators to read the time required for light to travel 1 m (/H11005 1 299,792,458 s).', metadata={'source': 'Tipler_Llewellyn.pdf', 'page': 30}), Document(page_content='This can be done simply by having an observer at each clock set that time on the in-dicator and then having the flash from the reference clock start them as it passes. Theclocks 1 m from the origin now display the same time as the reference clock; i.e., theyare all synchronized. In a similar fashion, all of the clocks throughout the inertialframe can be synchronized since the distance of any clock from the reference clockcan be calculated from the space coordinates of its position in the lattice and the initialsetting of its indicator will be the corresponding travel time for the reference lightflash. This procedure can be used to synchronize the clocks in any inertial frame, but\\nit does not synchronize the clocks in reference frames that move with respect to oneanother. Indeed, as we shall see shortly, clocks in relatively moving frames cannot ingeneral be synchronized with one another.>', metadata={'source': 'Tipler_Llewellyn.pdf', 'page': 30}), Document(page_content='14 Chapter 1 Relativity I\\nWhen an event occurs, its location and time are recorded instantly by the nearest\\nclock. Suppose that an atom located at x/H110052 m, y/H110053 m, z/H110054 m in Figure 1-13 emits\\na tiny flash of light at t/H1100521 s on the clock at that location. That event is recorded in\\nspace and in time or, as we will henceforth refer to it, in the spacetime coordinate sys-\\ntem with the numbers (2,3,4,21). The observer may read out and analyze these data at\\nhis leisure, within the limits set by the information transmission time (i.e., the light traveltime) from distant clocks. For example, the path of a particle moving through the latticeis revealed by analysis of the records showing the particle’s time of passage at eachclock’s location. Distances between successive locations and the corresponding time dif-ferences make possible the determination of the particle’s velocity. Similar records of thespacetime coordinates of the particle’s path can, of course, also be made in any inertialframe moving relative to ours, but to compare the distances and time intervals measuredin the two frames requires that we consider carefully the relativity of simultaneity.\\nRelativity of Simultaneity\\nEinstein’s postulates lead to a number of predictions about measurements made by ob-servers in inertial frames moving relative to one another that initially seem verystrange, including some that appear paradoxical. Even so, these predictions have beenexperimentally verified; and nearly without exception, every paradox is resolved byan understanding of the relativity of simultaneity, which states that\\nTwo spatially separated events simultaneous in one reference frame arenot, in general, simultaneous in another inertial frame moving relative tothe first.Figure 1-13\\nInertial reference frame formed\\nfrom a lattice of measuring rods with a clock at\\neach intersection.

Suppose two observers, both in the in-\\nertial frame S at different locations A and B, agree to explode bombs at time to\\n(remember, we have synchronized all of the clocks in S ). The clock at C , equidistant\\nfrom AandB, will record the arrival of light from the explosions at the same instant, i.e.,\\nsimultaneously. Other clocks in S will record the arrival of light from A orBfirst, de-\\npending on their locations, but after correcting for the time the light takes to reach each\\nclock, the data recorded by each would lead an observer to conclude that the explosionswere simultaneous. We will thus define two events to be simultaneous in an inertialreference frame if the light signals from the events reach an observer halfway betweenthem at the same time as recorded by a clock at that location , called a local clock.\\nEinstein’s Example To show that two events that are simultaneous in frame S are\\nnot simultaneous in another frame S/H11032moving relative to S, we use an example intro-\\nduced by Einstein. A train is moving with speed vpast a station platform. We have ob-\\nservers located at A/H11032,B /H11032, and C/H11032at the front, back, and middle of the train. (We con-\\nsider the train to be at rest in S/H11032 and the platform in S.) We now suppose that the train\\nand platform are struck by lightning at the front and back of the train and that thelightning bolts are simultaneous in the frame of the platform ( S; Figure 1-14a).\\nThat is, an observer located at C halfway between positions A andB, where lightning\\nstrikes, observes the two flashes at the same time.

In S/H11032 the\\nflash from the front of the train isrecorded by the C/H11032 clock, located\\nmidway between the scorch marks onthe train, before that from the rear of thetrain (b andd, respectively). Thus, the\\nC/H11032observer concludes that the strikes\\nwere not simultaneous.', metadata={'source': 'Tipler_Llewellyn.pdf', 'page': 32}), Document(page_content='16 Chapter 1 Relativity I\\nlightning scorches both the train and the platform so that the events can be easily lo-\\ncated in each reference frame. Since C/H11032 is in the middle of the train, halfway between\\nthe places on the train that are scorched, the events are simultaneous in S/H11032only if the\\nclock at C/H11032 records the flashes at the same time. However, the clock at C/H11032records\\nthe flash from the front of the train before the flash from the back. In frame S, when\\nthe light from the front flash reaches the observer at C/H11032, the train has moved some dis-\\ntance toward A, so that the flash from the back has not yet reached C/H11032, as indicated in\\nFigure 1-14b. The observer at C/H11032must therefore conclude that the events are not si-\\nmultaneous, but that the front of the train was struck before the back. Figures 1-14 c\\nand 1-14d illustrate, respectively, the subsequent simultaneous arrival of the flashes at\\nCand the still-later arrival of the flash from the rear of the train at C/H11032. As we have dis-\\ncussed, all observers in S/H11032on the train will agree with the observer C/H11032 when they have\\ncorrected for the time it takes light to reach them.\\nThe corollary can also be demonstrated with a similar example. Again consider\\nthe train to be at rest in S/H11032that moves past the platform, at rest in S, with speed v.\\nFigure 1-15 shows three of the clocks in the Slattice and three of those in the S/H11032\\nlattice. The clocks in each system’s lattice have been synchronized in the mannerthat was described earlier, but those in S are not synchronized with those in S/H11032. The\\nobserver at C midway between A andBon the platform announces that light sources\\natAandBwill flash when the clocks at those locations read t\\no(Figure 1-15a). The\\nobserver at C/H11032, positioned midway between A/H11032andB/H11032, notes the arrival of the light\\nflash from the front of the train (Figure 1-15b) before the arrival of the one from the\\nrear (Figure 1-15d). Observer C/H11032 thus concludes that if the flashes were each emitted\\nattoon the local clocks, as announced, then the clocks at AandBare not synchro-\\nnized. All observers in S/H11032 would agree with that conclusion after correcting for the\\ntime of light travel. The clock located at C records the arrival of the two flashes\\nsimultaneously, of course, since the clocks in Sare synchronized (Figure 1-15c).\\nFigure 1-15 (a) Light flashes originate\\nsimultaneously at clocks AandB,\\nsynchronized in S.

Explain why the fact that observers in S andS/H11032measure different\\ndirections for a particle’s motion is not an inconsistency in their observations.\\nSpacetime Diagrams\\nThe relativistic discovery that time intervals between events are not the same for allobservers in different inertial reference frames underscores the four-dimensionalcharacter of spacetime. With the diagrams that we have used thus far, it is difficult todepict and visualize on the two-dimensional page events that occur at different times,since each diagram is equivalent to a snapshot of spacetime at a particular instant.Showing events as a function of time typically requires a series of diagrams, such asFigures 1-14, 1-15, and 1-16, but even then our attention tends to be drawn to thespace coordinate systems rather than the events, whereas it is the events that are fun-\\ndamental. This difficulty is removed in special relativity with a simple yet powerfulgraphing method called the spacetime diagram. (This is just a new name given to thetvs.xgraphs that you first began to use when you discussed motion in introductory\\nphysics.) On the spacetime diagram we can graph both the space and time coordi-nates of many events in one or more inertial frames, albeit with one limitation. Sincethe page offers only two dimensions for graphing, we suppress, or ignore for now,two of the space dimensions, in particular yandz. With our choice of the relative\\nmotion of inertial frames along the x axis, y/H11032/H11005y andz/H11032/H11005z anyhow. (This is one of\\nthe reasons we made that convenient choice a few pages back, the other reason beingmathematical simplicity.)

Should we need the other two dimensions, e.g., in a\\nconsideration of velocity vector transformations, we can always use the Lorentztransformation equations.\\nIn a spacetime diagram the space location of each event is plotted along the x axis\\nhorizontally and the time is plotted vertically. From the three-dimensional array ofmeasuring rods and clocks in Figure 1-13, we will use only those located on the xaxis,\\nas in Figure 1-19. (See, things are simpler already!) Since events that exhibit relativis-tic effects generally occur at high speeds, it will be convenient to multiply the timescale by the speed of light (a constant), which enables us to use the same units and scaleon both the space and time axes, e.g., meters of distance and meters of light traveltime.\\n13The time axis is, therefore, ctimes the time t in seconds, i.e., ct. As we will see\\nshortly, this choice prevents events from clustering about the axes and makes possiblethe straightforward addition of other inertial frames into the diagram.\\nAs time advances, notice that in Figure 1-19 each clock in the array moves verti-\\ncally upward along the dotted lines. Thus, as events A ,B,C,a n d  Doccur in spacetime,\\none of the clocks of the array is at (or very near) each event when it happens.Remember that the clocks in the reference frame are synchronized, and so the differ-ence in the readings of clocks located at each event records the proper time interval be-\\ntween the events. (See Example 1-3.) In the figure, events A andDoccur at the same\\nplace (x /H110052 m) but at different times. The time interval between them measured on\\nclock 2 is the proper time interval since clock 2 is located at both events. Events A and\\nBoccur at different locations but at the same time (i.e., simultaneously in this frame).\\nEvent Coccurred before the present since ct /H11005/H11002 1 m. For this discussion we will con-\\nsider the time that the coordinate origins coincide, , to be the present.\\nWorldlines in Spacetime Particles moving in space trace out a line in the spacetime\\ndiagram called the worldline of the particle. The worldline is the “trajectory” of the par-\\nticle on a ct versus xgraph. To illustrate, consider four particles moving in space\\n(not spacetime) as shown in Figure 1-20a , which shows the array of synchronized clocks\\non the x axis and the space trajectories of four particles, each starting at x /H110050 and mov-\\ning at some constant speed during 3 m of time. Figure 1-20 bshows the worldline for\\neach of the particles in spacetime.

This means that the particle’s possibleworldlines for times greater than must lie within the heavily shaded triangle.\\nAnalyzing events and motion in inertial systems that are in relative motion can\\nnow be accomplished more easily than with diagrams such as Figures 1-14 through1-18. Suppose we have two inertial frames SandS/H11032with S/H11032moving in the /H11001x direc-\\ntion of S at speed v as in those figures. The clocks in both systems are started at\\nt/H11005t/H11032/H110050 (the present) as the two origins x /H110050 and x/H11032/H110050 coincide, and, as before,\\nobservers in each system have synchronized the clocks in their respective systems.The spacetime diagram for S is, of course, like that in Figure 1-19, but how does S/H11032\\nappear in that diagram, i.e., with respect to an observer in S? Consider that as the ori-\\ngin of S/H11032 (i.e., the point where x/H11032/H110050) moves in S, its worldline is the ct/H11032 axis since\\nthect/H11032axis is the locus of all points with x/H11032/H110050 (just as the ct axis is the locus of points\\nwith x/H110050.) Thus, the slope of the ct/H11032 axis as seen by an observer in Scan be found\\nfrom Equation 1-18, the Lorentz transformation, as follows:\\nx/H11032/H11005/H9253 (x/H11002vt)/H110050 for x/H11032/H110050\\nor\\nx/H11005vt/H11005(vc)(ct) /H11005/H9252ct\\nand\\nct/H11005(1/H9252)x\\nwhich says that the slope (in S) of the worldline of the point x/H11032/H11005\\n0, the ct/H11032axis, is 1 /H9252.\\n(See Figure 1-22a.)\\nIn the same manner, the x/H11032 axis can be located using the fact that it is the locus of\\npoints for which ct/H11032/H110050.

Let the train, system S /H11032,b e\\na rocket train with v /H110050.5c. As in the earlier discussion, clocks at C andC/H11032both read\\n0 as C /H11032passes C. Figure 1-23 shows this situation. It is the spacetime equivalent of\\nFigure 1-15.\\nTwo events occur, the light flashes. The flashes are simultaneous in S since both\\noccur at ct /H110050. In S /H11032, however, the event at Aoccurred at ct/H11032 (A/H11032) (see Figure 1-23),\\nabout 1.2 ct/H11032 units before ct/H11032/H110050, and the event at B occurred at ct/H11032 (B/H11032), about 1.2 ct/H11032\\nunits after ct/H11032/H110050. Thus, the flashes are not simultaneous in S/H11032andAoccurs before\\nB, as we also saw in Figure 1-15.\\nEXPLORING\\nCalibrating the Spacetime Axes\\nBy calibrating the coordinate axes of S/H11032consistent with the Lorentz transformation,\\nwe will be able to read the coordinates of events and calculate space and time intervals\\nbetween events as measured in both SandS/H11032directly from the diagram, in addition\\nto calculating them from Equations 1-18 and 1-19. The calibration of the S/H11032axes is', metadata={'source': 'Tipler_Llewellyn.pdf', 'page': 45}), Document(page_content='1-4 Time Dilation and Length Contraction 29\\nstraightforward and is accomplished as follows. The locus of points, e.g., with x/H11032/H110051 m,\\nis a line parallel to the ct/H11032 axis through the point x/H11032/H110051 m, ct/H11032/H110050, just as we saw ear-\\nlier that the ct/H11032 axis was the locus of those points with x/H11032/H110050 through the point x/H11032/H110050,\\nct/H11032/H110050. Substituting these values into the Lorentz transformation for x/H11032, we see that\\nthe line through x/H11032/H110051 m intercepts the x axis, i.e., the line where ct /H110050 at\\n1-24\\nor, in general,\\nIn Figure 1-22b, where /H9252/H110050.5, the line x/H11032/H110051 m intercepts the xaxis at x/H11005\\n0.866 m. Similarly, if x/H11032/H110052 m, x/H110051.73 m; if x/H11032/H110053 m, x/H110052.60 m; and so on.\\nThect/H11032axis is calibrated in a precisely equivalent manner. The locus of points with\\nct/H11032/H110051 m is a line parallel to the x/H11032 axis through the point ct/H11032/H110051 m, x/H11032/H110050. Using the\\nLorentz transformation, the intercept of that line with the ct axis (where x /H110050) is found\\nas follows:\\nwhich can also be written as \\n1-25\\norct/H11032/H11005/H9253 ctforx/H110050. Thus, for ct/H11032/H110051 m, we have 1 /H11005/H9253 ctor ct /H11005 (1/H11002/H92522) and,\\nagain in general, ct/H11005ct/H11032(1/H11002/H92522).  T h e x/H11032ct/H11032coordinate grid is shown in Figure 1-22 b.\\nNotice in Figure 1-22b that the clocks located in S/H11032 arenotfound to be synchro-\\nnized by observers in S, even though they are synchronized in S/H11032. This is exactly the\\nconclusion that we arrived at in the discussion of the lightning striking the train and\\nplatform. In addition, those with positive x/H11032 coordinates are behind the S/H11032reference\\nclock and those with negative x/H11032 coordinates are ahead, the differences being greatest\\nfor those clocks farthest away. This is a direct consequence of the Lorentz transforma-tion of the time coordinate—i.e., when ct/H110050 in Equation 1-25, ct/H11032 /H11005 /H11002/H9253/H9252x. Note,\\ntoo, that the slope of the worldline of the light beam equals 1 in S/H11032as well as in S,a s\\nrequired by the second postulate.\\n1-4 Time Dilation and Length Contraction\\nThe results of correct measurements of the time and space intervals between events\\ndo not depend upon the kind of apparatus used for the measurements or on the eventsthemselves. We are free therefore to choose any events and measuring apparatus thatwill help us understand the application of the Einstein postulates to the results of mea-surements. As you have already seen from previous examples, convenient events inrelativity are those that produce light flashes. A convenient, simple such clock is alight clock, pictured schematically in Figure 1-24.

Since light travels\\nwith speed c, this time is ¢t/H11032/H11005(2D) c.\\nNow consider these same two events, the original flash of light and the return-\\ning flash, as observed in reference frame S, with respect to which S/H11032 is moving to the\\nright with speed v. The events happen at two different places, and in frame Sbecause between the original flash and the return flash observer A/H11032 has moved a hor-\\nizontal distance v¢t, where ¢tis the time interval between the events measured in S.x\\n2, x1>Figure 1-24 Light clock for\\nmeasuring time intervals.

However, by Einstein’s postulates, light travels with the same speed c\\nin frame S as it does in frame S/H11032. Since it travels farther in S at the same speed, it takes\\nlonger in S to reach the mirror and return. The time interval between flashes in Sis\\nthus longer than it is in S /H11032. We can easily calculate ¢ tin terms of ¢t/H11032.

Thus, observers in Sconclude that the clock at\\nA/H11032inS/H11032runs slow since that clock measures a smaller time interval between the two\\nevents. Notice that the faster S/H11032 moves with respect to S, the larger is /H9253, and the slower\\ntheS/H11032clocks will tick. It appears to the Sobserver that time is being stretched out\\nin S/H11032.\\nBe careful! The same clock must be located at each event for ¢t/H11032 to be the proper\\ntime interval /H9270. We can see why this is true by noting that Equation 1-26 can be ob-\\ntained directly from the inverse Lorentz transformation for t.

Onebasis for this suggestion is an appealing symmetry: ordinary particles always havev/H11021c, and photons and other massless particles have v/H11005c, so the existence of particles\\nwith v/H11022cwould give a sort of satisfying completeness to the classification of particles.\\nCalled tachyons, their existence would present relativity with serious but not necessar-\\nily insurmountable problems of infinite creation energies and causality paradoxes, e.g.,alteration of history. (See the next example.) No compelling theoretical arguments pre-clude their existence and eventual discovery; however, to date, all experimentalsearches for tachyons\\n24have failed to detect them, and the limits set by those experi-\\nments indicate that it is highly unlikely they exist.\\nEXAMPLE 1-15 Tachyons and Reversing History Use tachyons and an appropriate\\nspacetime diagram to show how the existence of such particles might be used tochange history and, hence, alter the future, leading to a paradox.\\nSOLUTION\\nIn a spacetime diagram of the laboratory frame S the worldline of a particle with\\nv/H11022ccreated at the origin traveling in the /H11001x direction makes an angle less than 45°\\nwith the x axis; i.e., it is below the light worldline, as shown in Figure 1-42. After\\nsome time the tachyon reaches a tachyon detector mounted on a spaceship movingrapidly away at v /H11021cin the /H11001x direction. The spaceship frame S/H11032 is shown in the\\nfigure at P. The detector immediately creates a new tachyon, sending it off in the /H11002x/H11032direction and, of course, into the future of S/H11032, i.e., with ct/H11032/H110220. The second tachyon\\nreturns to the laboratory at x /H110050 but at a time ct before the first tachyon was emitted,\\nhaving traveled into the past of Sto point M, where ct/H110210. Having sent an object into\\nour own past, we would then have the ability to alter events that occur after Mand\\nproduce causal contradictions.

Even the chapter on thermodynamics does not\\ninvestigate the rate of reaction. As a matter of fact, many texts speciﬁcally state that rateof reaction is not tied\\nto thermodynamic considerations. The branch of chemistry that treats the rates of reactions is chemical kinetics .\\nThere are two main objectives in this chapter. The ﬁrst objective is to provide a systematic approach for dealing\\nwith data relating to the dependence of the rates of reactions on controllable variables. The second objective is\\nto show the relationship between reaction rate and the reaction’s molecular mechanism.\\nRATE CONSTANTS AND THE ORDER OF REACTIONS\\nHomogeneous reactions are those reactions that occur within a single phase (physical state), especially a\\nliquid or gaseous phase. Heterogeneous reactions are those reactions that take place at least in part at the interface\\nbetween two phases, such as solid and liquid or liquid and gas, etc. The discussion and problems in this chapter\\nwill address homogeneous reactions unless otherwise stated. Please note that rate means that there is a time\\nelement involved which is usually expressed in seconds (s), minutes (min), or hours (h).\\nAccording to the law of mass action , the rate of chemical reaction at a constant temperature (amount of\\nreaction per unit of time) depends only on the concentrations of the substances that inﬂuence the rate. The\\nsubstances that inﬂuence the rate of reaction are usually one or more of the reactants, but can occasionally be a\\nproduct. Another inﬂuence on the rate of reaction can be a catalyst that does not appear in the balanced overall\\nchemical equation.\\nThe dependence of the rate of reaction on the concentrations can often be expressed as a direct proportionality\\nin which the concentrations may appear to the zero, ﬁrst, or second power. The power to which the concentration\\nof a substance appears in the rate expression (formula) is the order of the reaction with respect to that substance.\\nTable 20-1 provides examples of rate expressions.\\nThe order is not a result of the nature of the chemical equation; it is dependent on data collected from\\nexperiments. Those data are then used to determine a mathematical equation that ﬁts, the rate equation . The\\noverall order of a reaction is the sum of the orders with respect to various substances (the sum of the exponents).\\nFurther, the order of a reaction is stated with respect to a named substance in the reaction (see listing above).\\nThe proportionality factor, k, called the rate constant orspeciﬁc rate , is constant at a ﬁxed temperature. The\\nrate constant varies with temperature. There are dimensions to k, and the units should be expressed when the\\nk-values are tabulated. The rate itself is deﬁned as the change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit\\nof time.

Troubling\\nquestions can be raised: How many successive steps are there in the overall process? What are the spatial and\\nenergetic requirements for the interactions in each step? What is the rate of each step? A positive point is that\\nrate measurements usually describe the overall reaction, but the measurement of rates under different conditions\\ncan often ﬁll in the information needed for the understanding of reaction mechanisms.', metadata={'source': 'schaums-college-chemistry-407.pdf', 'page': 363}), Document(page_content='350 RATES OF REACTIONS [CHAP. 20\\nMolecularity\\nThe concept of molecularity speciﬁes the number of molecules interacting in an individual reaction step.\\nAunimolecular reaction is a step in which a single molecule spontaneously undergoes a reaction. A bimolecular\\nreaction refers to the reaction of two molecules. In a termolecular reaction, three molecules interact in a single\\nstep. There are no known single-step reactions of higher molecularity than termolecular.\\nAunimolecular reaction is ﬁrst-order in the species that undergoes the spontaneous rearrangement or\\ndecomposition. This is true because there is a natural probability that a molecule will undergo the reaction\\nin a speciﬁc time interval. Also, the overall rate per unit volume is the product of this probability per unit time\\nand the total number of molecules per unit volume (which in turn is proportional to concentration).\\nAbimolecular reaction rate is proportional to the frequency of collisions between the two molecules of the\\nreacting species. It is known from kinetic theory that the frequency of collisions between two like molecules,\\nA, is proportional to [A]2, and the frequency of collisions between an A and a B molecule is proportional to the\\nproduct of the concentrations, [A][B]. If the species whose molecules collide are starting materials in limited\\nconcentrations, the reaction is second-order. This reaction follows the rate equation of either type ( 3)o r( 2),\\nTable 20-1.\\nAtermolecular reaction rate is proportional to the frequency of the collision of three bodies. These reactions\\nare proportional to [A]3, [A]2[B], or [A][B][C], depending on whether the molecules taking part in the reaction\\nare of one, two, or three species. If these species are the starting materials, the reaction is third-order; however,\\ntermolecular reactions are rare because of the low probability that three species will come together.\\nAlthough the order of a single step can be predicted from the molecularity, the molecularity of a step, or\\nsteps, cannot be predicted from the order of the overall reaction. There are a number of complications which make\\nit impossible to automatically determine the order of the reaction. In other words, stating that a unimolecular\\nreaction is ﬁrst-order, that a bimolecular reaction is second-order, or a termolecular reaction is third-order cannot\\nbe made with ensured accuracy . In many cases, the reaction is a sequence of steps, and the overall rate is governed\\nby the slowest step(s). Experimental conditions might interchange the relative speeds of different steps, making\\nthe order appear to change. Another complication arises because the slowest (rate-limiting) step may involve the\\nreaction of an unstable intermediate species, and it is necessary to express the concentration of this species in\\nterms of the reactants before the overall order of the reaction can be determined. The solved problems provide\\nexamples of some of these complexities.\\nEnergetics\\nMost molecular collisions do not result in reaction. Even if the appropriate number of molecules came\\ntogether, only those possessing enough energy can undergo the violent distortions of bond lengths and angles\\nnecessary for the rearrangements that lead to chemical reaction. Often times, the amount of energy necessary is\\na great deal more than the average energy of the molecules. The energy of activation ,Ea, is a measure of the\\nenergy necessary to get the molecules to react. The exponential term in the Arrhenius equation, ( 20-4), is of the\\norder of magnitude of the fraction of molecules possessing the necessary amount of energy beyond the average.\\nTheactivated state has been deﬁned as that distorted combination of reacting molecules having the minimum\\namount of excess energy (beyond the average energy of the molecules) so that the combination, or complex , could\\nas easily rearrange to form the products as revert to the reactants. The energy of the activated state may be thought', metadata={'source': 'schaums-college-chemistry-407.pdf', 'page': 364}), Document(page_content='as easily rearrange to form the products as revert to the reactants.

The hydrolysis of ( i-C3H7O)2POF was studied at different acidities. The apparent ﬁrst-order rate constant, k,a ta\\nparticular temperature was found to depend on pH but not on the nature or concentration of the buffer used to regulate\\nthe pH. The value of kwas fairly constant from pH 4 to pH 7, but rose from this constant value with decreasing pH\\nbelow 4 or with increasing pH above 7. What is the nature of the cause of this behavior?\\nAns. The reaction is catalyzed by either H+or OH−.\\n20.33. It has been found that the rates of reaction of a ketone in mildly basic solution are identical for the following three\\nreactions: ( a) reaction with Br 2leading to the substitution of an H on the ketone by a Br; ( b) conversion of the\\nd-isomer of the ketone into a mixture of d- and l-isomers of equal concentration; and ( c) isotopic exchange of\\na hydrogen atom on the carbon next to the C =O group of the ketone by a deuterium atom in the solvent. The rate\\nof each of these reactions is equal to k[ketone][OH−] and is independent of [Br 2]. What can be concluded about the\\nmechanism from these observations?\\nAns. The rate-determining step for all three reactions must be the preliminary reaction of the ketone with OH−,\\nprobably leading to the conjugate base of the ketone. The conjugate base subsequently reacts very rapidly with\\n(a)B r2;(b) some acid in the medium; or ( c) the solvent with deuterium.\\n20.34. Many free radical reactions (polymerization and others) can be initiated by a light-sensitive substance, P.The molecules\\nof P dissociate into two free radicals on the absorption of a photon. The following reactions are either propagation ,i n\\nwhich one radical, R•, is produced for each radical consumed, or termination , in which two radicals combine to form\\nproducts that are not radicals. The bulk of the chemical change is due to the propagation step. A small steady-state\\nconcentration of free radicals prevails throughout. Explain how such a mechanism accounts for the dependence of\\nthe rate on the square root of the light intensity, I.\\nAns. Since propagation does not change the free radical concentration, the rate of initiation must equal the rate\\nof termination. If the rate of initiation is ﬁrst-order in P and proportional to the light intensity, ki[P]I, and the rate of\\ntermination is a bimolecular reaction with a rate, kt[R•]1/2, then at the steady state,\\n[R•]=[ (ki/kt)[P]I]1/2\\nIf the propagation step is ﬁrst-order in [R•], i.e., proportional to [R•], then the observed rate is as shown above,\\nproportional to I1/2.\\n20.35. The addition of a catalyst to a certain reaction provides an alternative pathway in which the energy of activation is\\nless than that of the uncatalyzed reaction by 14.7 kJ/mol. By what factor is the rate constant increased by the catalyst\\nat a temperature of 420 K? By what factor is the rate constant of the reverse reaction increased? (Assume that the\\nfrequency factor is not affected by the catalyst.)\\nAns. 67, the same as for the reverse reaction', metadata={'source': 'schaums-college-chemistry-407.pdf', 'page': 375}), Document(page_content='CHAPTER 21\\nNuclear Processes\\nIn the chemistry that we have worked with so far, the atoms of reactants rearrange to form product molecules\\ndifferent from those reactants. In such reactions, the outer electrons of the atoms may be transferred completely\\nor in part from one atom to another. The nuclei of the atoms are unchanged.\\nThere are other reactions in which the nuclei themselves are broken down and the products do not contain the\\nsame elements as the reactants. The chemistry of such nuclear reactions is called nuclear chemistry . Spontaneous\\ndisintegration of individual nuclei is usually accompanied by high-energy emissions and/or high-speed particles.\\nThese products and, sometimes, the reactions that produce them are referred to as radioactivity . Additionally,\\nthere are other nuclear changes resulting from the interactions of a neutron or high-energy photon with a nucleus,\\nor from the impact of a high-velocity particle.

If we could imagine a reaction in which free protons, neutrons, and electrons combine to form an atom,\\nwe would ﬁnd that the mass of the atom is slightly less than the total mass of the component particles (an exception\\nis1H as there is only 1 nuclear part, the proton). Further, a tremendous amount of energy is released during the\\nreaction which produces the atom. The loss in mass is exactly equivalent to the released energy, according to\\nEinstein’s famous equation,\\nE=mc2Energy =(change in mass) ×(velocity of light)2\\nThe calculated gain of energy equivalent to the loss of mass is called the binding energy of the atom (or nucleus,\\nif it is being considered independently of the electrons in the shells).

A free proton is the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, and is assigned the notation1\\n1H.\\n3. A free neutron is assigned zero atomic number because it has no charge. The mass number of a neutron is 1.\\nThe full notation for a neutron is1\\n0n.\\n4. An electron ( e−orβ−) is assigned the mass number zero and the atomic number −1. We will use0\\n−1efor\\nthe full notation, if the electron is part of an atom. We will use0\\n−1βorβ−if the electron is emitted (a beta\\nparticle).\\n5. A positron ( e+orβ+) is assigned the mass number zero and the atomic number +1. The full notation for a\\npositron we will be using is0\\n+1βorβ+, since the positron is only to be covered as an emitted particle in this\\nchapter (conforming to 4 above).\\n6. An alpha particle (α-particle) is a helium nucleus. The full notation for an α-particle is4\\n2He (or4\\n2α).\\n7. A gamma ray (γ) is a very high-energy photon (Chapter 8). It has zero as the mass number and zero charge.\\nThe full notation for a gamma ray is0\\n0γ.\\n8. In a balanced equation, the sum of the subscripts (atomic numbers), written or implied, must be the same on\\nthe two sides of the equation. The sum of the superscripts (mass numbers), written or implied, must also be\\nthe same on the two sides of the equation.

The example commonly used to teach the\\nconcept is that of getting water from a source to a ﬁre. A bucket brigade is formed for passing water from one\\nperson to the next, and so on, until it ﬁnally reaches the ﬁre. The overall rate of transfer of water cannot be\\ngreater than the rate of the slowest person in the brigade. In the above reactions, the activation step ( 1) becomes\\nthe slowest step when [A] is low and the reaction step ( 3) becomes the slowest step when [A] is high. Step ( 1),\\ndepending on the square of [A], is more sensitive to pressure than step ( 3).\\n20.16.
