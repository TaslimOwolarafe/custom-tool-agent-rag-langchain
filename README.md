#### Chemistry & Physics Q&A System with LangFlow
This project implements a question answering system specifically focused on answering chemistry and physics questions using LangFlow.

#### Requirements:

LangFlow server instance (see https://www.langflow.org/ for installation instructions)
Setup:

#### Download: Download the CRRNP-Taslim.json file from this repository.
Upload: Upload the downloaded CRRNP-Taslim.json file to your LangFlow server instance. You can typically upload flows through the LangFlow user interface or API.
#### Functionality: 

This LangFlow flow leverages the following components:

- Eden AI Integration: Uses custom components to interact with Eden AI's large language models to understand user queries and access relevant scientific knowledge.
- FAISS Integration: Utilizes FAISS for efficient retrieval of accurate answers from scientific databases.
- Text Embeddings: Employs Eden AI embeddings of textbook sources to enhance answer accuracy and context.
#### Getting Started:
Once uploaded, you can interact with the Q&A system through your LangFlow server instance.
